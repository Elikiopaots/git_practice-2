Hello Git and GitHub

Try and make some changes

Let do it again again

Want to try the reset using SHA

Time to try some branching	

So now adding more stuff in new branch and merge

Then probably do some merge conflict

Eh so I gonna make some changes, and push to origin to see if it works.

Going to make a branch then push again, so it won't merge with the master branch in origin.

Make more changes and see if it will affect fetch in mygp.
