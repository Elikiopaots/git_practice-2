Hello Git and GitHub

Try and make some changes

Let do it again again

Want to try the reset using SHA

Time to try some branching	

So now adding more stuff in new branch and merge

Then probably do some merge conflict

Eh so I gonna make some changes, and push to origin to see if it works.

Going to make a branch then push again, so it won't merge with the master branch in origin.

Now make changes and merge again in mygp but in new-gp branch

Now make more changes, to see if this overwrite mygp. Now is origin master.

Shag, let's make changes to see if this will overwrite mygp-newgp branch or will it have conflict like merging with mygp-master

Alright, now try making changes here, add, commit and push and see what will happen.

Ok, can't just push, upstreaming issue. I can only push to origin and appear as a branch in GitHub.

Now let's try making changes here, then push to origin again.
