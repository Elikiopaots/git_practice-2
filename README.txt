Alright, now try making changes here, add, commit and push and see what will happen.

Ok, can't just push, upstreaming issue. I can only push to origin and appear as a branch in GitHub.

Now let's try making changes here, then push to origin again.

Alright ending soon, now try git desktop if it can fetch properly. Desktop seems easier to use lolol

Didn't work in desktop, worked on bash though... let's try again, maybe I missed something.
